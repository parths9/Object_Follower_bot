# Object_Follower_bot
Object following robot using Arduino
# About this project
In this project I have made an object following robot based on Arduino that uses proximity sensors like ultrasonic and infrared sensors(IR) to identify and track objects like the human hand and follow it. 
# Structure of the bot
I have made a 4 wheeled robot with a regular metal chassis and 12 volt geared DC motors. To control the motors I have used L298N motor driver module
